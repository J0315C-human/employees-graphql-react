## Folders
  - Hopefully the main folders are pretty obvious, but if they're not:
    - `assets/` is for any static image or binary file that has to be included.
    - `components/` is for React components.
    - `fixtures/` is test fixtures.
    - `typings/` is Typescript typings.
    - `utils/` is utilities and helpers.
